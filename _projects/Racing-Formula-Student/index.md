title: Formula Student Team Delft – Electric Race Car Development
description: |
  Over two consecutive seasons at Formula Student Team Delft, I contributed to the development of two generations of electric Formula-style race cars (DUT21 and DUT22). Working within a multidisciplinary team of 70–100 engineers, I supported drivetrain, chassis, and braking system development, later transitioning toward full vehicle electronics integration. My role evolved from mechanical design and manufacturing toward system-level integration, helping deliver a highly reliable competition vehicle that achieved 2nd place at Formula Student Netherlands.

# Engineering Context
Formula Student is the world’s largest student engineering competition, where university teams design, manufacture, and compete with fully functional Formula-style race cars. The challenge extends beyond racing performance: teams are evaluated on engineering design quality, reliability, cost efficiency, and system integration.

At Formula Student Team Delft, each year starts from a clean sheet. A new vehicle is developed every season, while building upon lessons learned from previous designs and continuously pushing performance within strict technical regulations. During two consecutive seasons, I contributed to the development of the DUT21 and DUT22 electric race cars.


## Engineering Challenge
Working in a team of approximately 70–100 engineers required treating the car not as individual parts, but as a tightly coupled system where mechanical, electrical, and performance decisions continuously influence each other. The main engineering challenge was balancing aggressive performance targets, lightweight design constraints, reliability requirements, strict Formula Student regulations and manufacturability within limited timeframes. Success required fast iteration cycles and close collaboration across disciplines while maintaining engineering rigor.

## DUT21 — Mechanical Design & Manufacturing

During the DUT21 season, my work focused primarily on mechanical systems development and validation. I contributed to the design and manufacturing of key components including:

- Drivetrain elements
- Gearbox interfaces
- Pedal box assembly
- Brake system components
- Chassis structures

Using CATIA, I developed production parts that were manufactured through CNC machining, milling, lathe operations, and composite lamination. Beyond design, I was actively involved in hands on manufacturing and assembly, closing the loop between CAD intent and performance. A major responsibility included mechanical testing and validation of suspension related systems to verify performance and reliability before track deployment. 

## DUT22 — System Integration & Electronics Packaging

In the following season, my role shifted toward system-level integration. For the DUT22 vehicle, I was responsible for the mechanical integration of the low-voltage electronics architecture inside the car. This included:

- Packaging and mounting of sensors
- Designing reliable routing and mounting solutions
- Ensuring maintainability and accessibility
- Integrating electronics within strict chassis packaging constraints

This role required balancing mechanical robustness, vibration resistance, and serviceability while working closely with electronics and control teams. Alongside integration work, I continued supporting manufacturing activities for key aerodynamic and chassis components, maintaining a strong connection between design intent and physical execution.


## Engineering Outcome
The DUT21 vehicle achieved:
- First place efficiency at FSA
- 316 out of 325 points for vehicle design at FSN

The DUT22 vehicle achieved:
- 0-100 in 1.8 seconds
- 7 podium spots at FSN

The team secured 2nd place at Formula Student Netherlands with the DUT22, demonstrating the effectiveness of both engineering execution and interdisciplinary collaboration.


## Engineering Contribution

My two-year trajectory at Formula Student Team Delft reflects the progression from component-level engineering toward full system thinking. Key takeaways from this experience:

- Designing with manufacturing constraints in mind
- Understanding the interaction between mechanical and electrical systems
- Working effectively inside a large multidisciplinary engineering organization
- Iterating rapidly under extreme deadlines while maintaining technical quality

This project strengthened my ability to bridge detailed engineering work with system-level integration, a mindset essential for complex real-world engineering challenges.
