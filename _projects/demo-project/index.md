title: Laser Based Chip Propulsion
description:  **Full research under embargo until 14-01-2028, key details may be missing** <br>
"Microchip handling systems face scaling limitations as chips shrink and production speeds increase. Conventional vacuum pick and place systems are constrained by nozzle size and clogging risks, making them infeasible for further scaling. During my research, I developed a new handling method using capillary based water droplets and laser driven propulsion to transfer microchips, designing and experimentally validating a method that converts laser energy into controlled chip propulsion. I performed coupled simulations and lab experiments to optimize system parameters, demonstrating a scalable approach that increases chip handling speed by over 60%, and that can be applied to a wide scale of chip sizes. This research is the foundation for a controlled implementation of a water-laser based semiconductor handling system into practice."

# Problem statement
As microchips continue to shrink and production speeds increase, conventional vacuum pick-and-place systems face scaling limitations due to nozzle size constraints and clogging risks.

In this project, I developed and validated a laser driven microchip propulsion mechanism that replaces vacuum gripping with:

- Capillary adhesion using a water droplet
- Laser induced explosive evaporation of the water to propel the chip

The goal was to identify a safe and repeatable concept in which a laser rapidly generates water vapour inside of the water droplet, generating pressure enough to propel a 0.1 mm² die. The strict constraint is to do this without damaging the die or the boundry system.


## Concept


### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>

{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
