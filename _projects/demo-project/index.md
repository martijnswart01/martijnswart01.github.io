title: Laser Based Chip Propulsion
description:  "Microchip handling systems face scaling limitations as chips shrink and production speeds increase: conventional vacuum pick-and-place systems are constrained by nozzle size and clogging risks. During my research, I developed a new handling method using capillary based water droplets and laser driven propulsion to transfer microchips, designing and experimentally validating a method that converts laser energy into controlled chip propulsion. I performed coupled simulations and lab experiments to optimize system parameters, demonstrating a scalable approach that significantly increases chip handling speed and can be applied to a wide range of chip sizes. This research is the foundation for a controlled implementation of a water-laser based semiconductor handling system into practice."

# Project overview
As microchips continue to shrink and production speeds increase, conventional vacuum pick-and-place systems face scaling limitations due to nozzle size constraints and clogging risks.

In this project, I developed and validated a laser driven microchip propulsion mechanism that replaces vacuum gripping with:

- Capillary adhesion using a water droplet
- Laser induced explosive evaporation of the water to propel the chip

The goal was to identify a safe and repeatable concept in which a laser rapidly generates water vapour inside of the water droplet, generating pressure enough to propel a 0.1 mm² die. The strict constraint is to do this without damaging the die or the boundry system.


## Concept


### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>

{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
