title: Visualising Pigments on Ancient Stela of Sehetepibreanch (4000 B.C.)
description: |
  As part of a multidisciplinary research project at TU Delft, I helped develop an imaging methodology to visualise hidden pigment traces on an ancient Egyptian limestone stela. By combining hyperspectral imaging, contrast-enhanced photography, and microscopy, we created a validated workflow that revealed previously unclear pigment structures without physically altering the artefact. The work demonstrates how engineering-based imaging methods can be applied to cultural heritage research.

## Engineering Context
Ancient Egyptian artefacts often contain pigment traces that are no longer visible to the human eye due to ageing and surface degradation. Recovering this information is essential for understanding historical context, craftsmanship, and symbolism, but physical restoration is often impossible. The challenge of this project was to develop a non destructive imaging method capable of revealing these hidden pigments digitally.

Within a research project conducted at TU Delft in collaboration with the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, our goal was to develop a non-invasive imaging methodology capable of revealing hidden pigment traces on the Stela of Sehetepibreanch, a limestone artefact dating from approximately 1850 BC.

## Engineering Challenge
The complexity of this project was not in capturing images, but in creating a workflow that could reliably separate real pigment information from surface texture, shadows, and noise. No single imaging method was sufficient on its own. The project therefore became a systems-engineering exercise in combining multiple technologies into a validated methodology.

To reduce risk and establish reliable parameters, we first designed a mock-up limestone sample containing known pigments. This allowed us to experiment with imaging settings, verify results, and understand how degradation influences measurable signals before moving to the real artefact.

## Method Development
The core of the project was building a coherent workflow from complementary imaging techniques. Contrast-enhanced photography was used as a fast way to amplify colour differences, while hyperspectral imaging provided wavelength data that could confirm whether observed features were actually pigment related.

By analysing reflectance behaviour across the visible and near infrared spectrum, it became possible to isolate spectral signatures corresponding to haematite red and bone black pigments. Microscopy was used as a verification step to confirm uncertain regions and validate the findings from the imaging methods. The key engineering step was defining how these techniques interacted rather than treating them separately. Contrast enhancement provided rapid visual insights, while hyperspectral analysis added physical validation, allowing the two methods to reinforce each other.

## Results

Applying the developed workflow to the Stela revealed pigment structures that were barely visible to the naked eye. Red illustrations became clearer, and black hieroglyphic markings could be interpreted more confidently. The resulting data enabled a partial digital reconstruction of the original pigment layout without any physical intervention on the artefact.

The combination of imaging methods proved more powerful than either technique alone, demonstrating that engineering-driven experimental design can significantly enhance scientific and archaeological analysis.

## Engineering Contribution
This project strengthened my ability to approach complex problems through structured experimentation and validation. Rather than focusing on a single tool, the work required designing an entire methodology that balanced experimental constraints, signal interpretation, and practical usability. It demonstrated how engineering principles (calibration, verification, and system integration) can be applied outside traditional mechanical domains, translating imaging physics into a repeatable workflow that delivers measurable scientific value.
